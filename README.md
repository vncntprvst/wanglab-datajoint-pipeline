# Sabatini Lab - DataJoint Workflow Setup Instructions

## For more information, please visit our [documentation page](https://wanglab-datajoint-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Installation and setting up local environment to access database

```
conda create -n wanglab-datajoint -c conda-forge python=3.9 -y

conda activate wanglab-datajoint
conda install graphviz python-graphviz pydotplus ipykernel ipywidgets nb_conda_kernels jupyterlab
```
```
git clone https://github.com/vncntprvst/wanglab-datajoint-pipeline
```
Navigate into cloned repository
`cd wanglab-datajoint-pipeline/`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install -e . 
```
- This step of pip installing in -editable mode, must be rerun if you want to test with local changes

Create a copy of `.example_dj_local_config.json`, rename it to `dj_local_conf.json` and fill in database user/host/password credentials

Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab and set kernel to the wanglab-datajoint conda environment
```

## Windows Nvidia GPU Configuration (using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL))

```
1. Update OS to allow for developer options: Windows 10 2022 Update | Version 22H2
2. Install WSL using powershell
3. Confirm Ubuntu exists in WSL installation by running

    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04

4. Set Ubuntu to use WSL2 

    wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2

5. Make sure that your version of Ubuntu is integrated in the docker app (Settings > Resources > WSL integration)
6. Install CUDA in WSL: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#getting-started-with-cuda-on-wsl
7. WSL-Ubuntu must be configured to be a root user in order to use Docker. Run in powershell: 

    ubuntu2004 config --default-user root

8. Install Cuda toolkit in WSL - Use Linux OS, x86_64 architecture, WSL-Ubuntu Distribution, Version 2.0, runfile(local). Then, follow the base installer instructions.

    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=runfile_local

9. Confirm that /etc/docker/daemon.json contains a runtime component pointing to the correct nvidia-container-runtime path. (This is updated by default in Ubuntu, but needs to be manually set in Windows)
10. Update all .env paths with WSL Ubuntu path format. For example: /mnt/c/Users/Janet/...
```

## Worker Deployment using Docker Container (in WSL)

```
Pipeline Operation
1. New data is added into the specfied directory 
2. Using Labbook insert into Subject, Session, and SessionDirectory tables
    SessionDirectory should point to the root raw data directory
3. Once workers are docker composed up they will begin working on populating tables
    - Standard Worker will work on populating BehaviorIngestion, EphysRecording, CuratedClustering, WaveformSet, LFP, ScanInfo, MotionCorrection, Segmentation, Fluorescence, and Activity 
    (all tables without large computational resources needed)
    - Spike Sorting Worker will work on populating Clustering table (runs kilosort)
    - Calcium Imaging Worker will work on populating Processing table (in Imaging schema)
4. For DLC operation, activate conda environment and run the DLC notebook to process new videos     
    through trained models.    
4. Workers will continually operate and will continue to do work if new data appears in the inbox folder.
    If no data is added, and data is not added to LabBook, the workers will not do anything until the data has been added.

Standard Worker Example (same for Calcium Imaging and DLC, just need cd to respective folder)

Within WSL: 

First, 

    cd ./docker/standard_worker/

Create a local .env file based on the template example.env
Will need to fill in DJ_PASS, ROOT_DATA_DIR, PROCESSED_DATA_DIR
    DJ_PASS - Datajoint Database Password
    ROOT_DATA_DIR - Local Inbox Data Directory 
    PROCESSED_DATA_DIR - Local Outbox Data Directory

Next, 

    cd ./docker/standard_worker/dist/debian/

Run Docker Commands to build/up worker images

    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-standard_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_standard build --no-cache

    --no-cache flag included will rebuild image without using cache

After image has been built in order to bring up the container
    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-standard_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_standard up -d

    -d flag will start the container detached, in the background, and the current terminal window can continue to be used

To bring down the container
    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-standard_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_standard down

    docker ps -a --> command to view all open containers, lists container-IDs
    docker logs [container-ID] -f --> command to view container logs (-f follows output)

Additional useful docker commands for docker memory management
    docker image prune 
        Removes all dangling images. If -a is specified, will also remove all images not referenced by any container.
    docker volume prune
        Removes all unused local volumes. Unused local volumes are those which are not referenced by any containers.
    docker system prune
        Removes all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.


Spike Sorting Worker Example

Within WSL:

First,

    cd ./docker/spike_sorting_local_worker/

Create a local .env file based on the template example.env
Will need to fill in MATLAB_HOSTID, MATLAB_FILE_KEY, DJ_PASS, ROOT_DATA_DIR, PROCESSED_DATA_DIR
    MATLAB_HOSTID - MAC Address supplied to Mathworks as HostID associated with license.
    MATLAB_FILE_KEY - Mathworks provided file key associated with installation.
    MATLAB_LICENSE_PATH - Local File Path location for MATLAB_LICENSE (.lic file)
    DJ_PASS - DataJoint Database Password
    ROOT_DATA_DIR - Local Inbox Data Directory 
    PROCESSED_DATA_DIR - Local Outbox Data Directory

Next, 

    cd ./docker/spike_sorting_local_worker/dist/debian/

Run Docker Commands to build/up worker images

    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-spike_sorting_local_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_spike build --no-cache

    --no-cache flag included will rebuild image without using cache

After image has been built in order to bring up the container
    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-spike_sorting_local_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_spike up -d

    -d flag will start the container detached, in the background, and the current terminal window can continue to be used

To bring down the container
    docker compose --env-file=../../.env -f docker-compose-spike_sorting_local_worker.yaml -p wanglab-datajoint-pipeline_spike down

```
